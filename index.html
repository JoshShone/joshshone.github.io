               Hi, i'm Joshua Shone, a Games Technology graduate from the University of the West of England. I'm 24 and I am continuing to work towards gaining as many skills as possible. I have used C++, C#, Unity and UE4, just to list a few, and I have branched out into other areas such as HTML, Python and Blender.            </p>

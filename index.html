               Hi, i'm Joshua Shone, a current 2nd year Games Technology student at the University of the West of England. I'm 21 and I am continuing to work towards getting the best grade possible in my degree. Whilst still trying to gain expertise in all areas of games development, looking forwards I would like to start specialising in level design. With my extensive playtime within competitive games, and already having some experience creating competitive maps, I feel like I should aim for that area of level design, however I know I should never box myself in as a developer. Therefore, I will try to take every step in trying to make myself the most complete games developer as possible.

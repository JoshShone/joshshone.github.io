        <p id = "ArtIntro">
            A gameplay programmer at their core, is a programmer that is responsible for code that directly affects the gameplay experience. The roles expectation can vary from company to company, so versatility is a gameplay programmer’s best strength.

        <h3 id = "Role">The Role</h3>
        <p>The role of a gameplay programmer will vary from company to company, but why? Well that depends on the size and seniority of the company and programmer. A great way to describe what a gameplay programmer does, is to ask one, and it is so elegantly put by Tiffany Wild of <i>Ubisoft Leamington</i>. <a href="https://intogames.org/news/what-does-a-games-gameplay-programmer-do-tiffany-wild">In an interview with intogames</a>, she says “I am like a baker for video games. I take the recipe from the games designers and the ingredients from artists and other programmers, and I use my techniques to combine everything into the most delicious game!”. This basically means, the gameplay programmer moves the art into interactable code. This can be in every aspect of the game they are working on, from system designs, networked gameplay, AI, UI and more.</p>
        <h3 id = "Skills">Variety of skills and experience</h3>
        <p>To make it at the top as a gameplay programmer, you’ll need a large variety of skills, since a lot of what a studio may need depends on their current project. Most importantly, you’ll obviously need to know how to code at a distinguishable level, across multiple different languages, but don’t worry you will be learning along the way. Good communication skills are also key, as well as the ability and desire to work in a team. It also helps to specialise with your widening skillset, this can make you a crucial part of the studio’s team, as your knowledge can provide another level to the game experience. A good example of what a gameplay programmer needs to aim for, is in this <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/jobs/view/gameplay-programmer-unannounced-project-386-at-ubisoft-2394684486?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic">job listing by Ubisoft.</a>

        <h3 id = "Salary">Salaries and other careers</h3>
        <p>Using Talent.com, which is a job searching website that also provides salary searches, we find that the average salary for a gameplay programmer in the <a href="https://uk.talent.com/salary?job=gameplay+programmer#:~:text=The%20average%20game%20programmer%20salary%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is,to%20%C2%A370%2C000%20per%20year">UK is £57,500/year.</a> Considering the <a href="https://www.findcourses.co.uk/inspiration/average-salaries-uk/average-uk-salary-2020-2021-19759"> national average wage</a>, for 2020, in the UK was £38,600, being a gameplay programmer can earn you some serious money. However, as we all know, that shouldn’t be a main factor of why you work in the gaming industry. But, after you’ve tried it out, you think the gaming industry isn’t for you, with the skills you should’ve trained and gained you will be a highly sought-after individual. This is especially true in other creative medias, such as the software development industry. The background of knowing your code and being creative will make you a very valuable asset for all future employers.

        <h3 id = "Advice">Advice for the future</h3>
        <p>Advice!? Yes, even without being a qualified gameplay developer, I feel like I’m obliged to give my own 2 cents. After looking through multiple different personal blogs, one thing really sticks out as being a universal trait, you need to <b>love</b> games. If you don’t love games, you won’t love making them, and therefore won’t want to learn. Another good trait to have is, the ability to want to learn. The games industry is going to be forever evolving, and if you don’t force yourself to stay ahead, you’ll very quickly fall behind. Nevertheless, if you do love games and do want to learn, you’re in for a long, but very fun, journey.</p>
